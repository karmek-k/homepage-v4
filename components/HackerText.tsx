          A hacker is someone who enjoys playful cleverness—not necessarily with
          computers. The programmers in the old MIT free software community of
          the 60s and 70s referred to themselves as hackers. Around 1980,
          journalists who discovered the hacker community mistakenly took the
          term to mean “security breaker.”

          Please don&apos;t spread this mistake. People who break security are
          “crackers.”
